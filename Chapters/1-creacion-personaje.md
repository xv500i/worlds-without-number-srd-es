# Character Creation

## Attributes

A character has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal human level.
Three of these attributes are physical.

- Strength, reflecting physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, and brute force.
- Dexterity, reflecting speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, and combat initiative.
- Constitution, reflecting hardiness, enduring injury, and tolerating large amounts of magical healing.

Three are mental attributes.

- Intelligence, reflecting memory, reasoning, technical skills, and general education.
- Wisdom, reflecting noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, and intuition.
- Charisma, reflecting commanding, charming, attracting attention, and being taken seriously.

NPCs do not normally have attributes. If necessary, the GM can choose them as appropriate, but usually they are assumed to have average scores if it’s ever relevant.

### Generating Attributes

To generate their six attributes, the player rolls 3d6 in order, once for each attribute.
At any point before section 1.5.0 in character creation the player may substitute a score of 14 for one rolled score.

Optionally, a player may choose to assign their stats from the following array of numbers: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7, divided up as desired among the attributes.
If an array is used a score may not be substituted with a 14 later.

### Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.
An attribute score of 3 has a modifier of -2. A score of 4-7 has a modifier of -1. A score of 8-13 has a modifier of +0. A score of 14-17 has a modifier of +1. A score of 18 has a modifier of +2.

Some Foci and abilities may add bonuses or penalties to an attribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2 unless explicitly indicated.
Some injuries or character advancements may alter an attribute score; this new score may change the attribute’s modifier.

## Skills

A character’s skills are the PC’s learned abilities.
A newly-created character starts with a few relevant skills and may acquire more as they advance in level.
NPCs do not have individual skills, instead relying on their combat stat line’s skill bonus when relevant.
See section 2.3.0 for the rules for making skill checks.

### Skill Levels

Skills are rated on a scale between level-0 and level-4.
A character must reach a certain minimum experience level to develop a skill to level-2 or beyond.

| Nivel   | Descripción                                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nivel-0 | Basic competence in the skill, such as an ordinary practitioner would have |
| Nivel-1 | An experienced professional in the skill, clearly better than most         |
| Nivel-2 | Veteran expert, one respected even by those with considerable experience   |
| Nivel-3 | Master of the skill, likely one of the best in the city                    |
| Nivel-4 | Superlative expertise, one of the best in the world                        |

### Gaining Skills in Character Creation

Characters gain skills from their Backgrounds as described in the section below and from a single free pick in section 1.7.4.
Some Foci also grant particular skills.
The first time a skill is picked or given, a character obtains it at level-0.
The second time it is picked or given, the skill becomes level-1.
The third and further times a skill is picked or given during character creation, the player instead picks any other skill that is not already level-1.
No character can begin play with skills above level-1.

### The Skill List

The following skills are standard to most fantasy campaigns. Gms may add or subtract from this list for specialized settings. Some skills may overlap at points in their application; the character may use either skill at their discretion.

- **Administer**: Keep an organization running smoothly, scribe things well, plan out logistics, identify incompetent or treacherous workers, analyze records or archives, or otherwise do things that an executive or middle-manager would need to do.
- **Connect**: Find or know people who are useful to your purposes, make friendships or social acquaintances, know who to talk to get favors or services, and call on the help or resources of organizations you belong to. Connect covers your PC’s ability to find the people you need, though convincing them to help may require more than this.
- **Convince**: Persuade a listener that something you are saying is true.
  Naturally, the more implausible the claim or more emotionally repugnant it is to them, the more difficult it is to persuade them.
  Furthermore, how they act on their newfound conviction is up to them and their motivations, and may not be perfectly predictable.
- **Craft**: Craft or repair goods and technology appropriate to the PC’s background and society.
  The Craft skill can be used for a wide range of artisan pursuits, though a GM is within their rights to keep the PC from building complex things that are too far away from their past background and experience.
- **Exert**: Run, swim, climb, jump, labor for long periods, throw things, or otherwise exert your physical strength, stamina, and coordination.
  Even a PC with poor physical attributes might have a good Exert skill reflecting athletic training and expertise in making the most of their available talents.
- **Heal**: Treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons, diagnose psychological health issues, and otherwise tend to the wounds of
  body and mind.
  The Heal skill cannot cure lost hit points directly, but it’s a vital skill in stabilizing Mortally Wounded allies or ensuring clean recovery.
- **Know**: Know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology, and other academic fields appropriate to a sage or scholar.
  While some sages might specialize in particular fields, most learned men and women in this age have a broad range of understanding, and will rarely be unable to even attempt to answer a question relevant to this skill.
- **Lead**: Inspire others to follow your lead and believe in your plans and goals.
  Manage subordinates and keep them focused, loyal, and motivated in the face of danger or failure.
  A successful leader will keep their subordinate’s faith and confidence even when reason might make the leader’s plan appear questionable at best.
- **Magic**: Cast or analyze magic and know things about famous mages or notable magical events.
  Classes that can’t cast spells obtain only intellectual and scholarly benefits from this skill.
- **Notice**: Notice small details, impending ambushes, hidden features, or concealed objects.
  Detect subtle smells, sounds, or other sensory input.
  Notice cannot be used simply to detect a lie, but keen attention can often discern a subject’s emotional state.
- **Perform**: Sing, act, dance, orate, or otherwise perform impressively for an audience.
  Compose music, plays, writings, or other works of performance art.
  Most performers will have a particular field they excel at, though polymaths might exist if the PC’s background is appropriate for such versatility.
- **Pray**: Perform the clerical rites of your religion, and be familiar with the gods, demons, and taboos of major and minor faiths, and identify iconography and persons of religious importance.
  Pray also helps you know the state of local faiths and the important persons in their hierarchies.
- **Punch**: Fight unarmed or with natural body weaponry. Punch, kick, grapple, or otherwise brawl without the benefit of man-made tools.
  This mode of fighting is inefficient at best without some special Focus to improve it, but it’s reliably non-lethal.
- **Ride**: Ride an animal, drive a cart or carriage, or otherwise deal with land transportation.
  This skill also includes competence at mount care and tending, basic cart or carriage repair, judging good horseflesh, and other skills appropriate to a beast-rider of whatever society the PC comes from.
- **Sail**: Sail or repair a ship, build small craft, navigate by the stars, read sea weather, manage sailors, and otherwise conduct the business of a professional mariner.
  This skill may apply to more esoteric means of vehicular travel in some societies.
- **Shoot**: Fire a bow or crossbow or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain ranged weaponry and fletch arrows.
- **Sneak**: Move silently, hide in shadows, avoid notice, pick pockets, disguise yourself, pick locks, defeat traps, or otherwise overcome security measures.
- **Stab**: Fight with melee weapons or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain and identify weaponry.
- **Survive**: Hunt, fish, navigate by the stars, mitigate environmental hazards, identify plants and wildlife, and craft basic survival tools and shelter.
  A PC’s Survive skill is most pertinent to the environments in their background, but the basic principles can be applied in all but the most alien environments.
- **Trade**: Buy and sell at a profit, identify the worth of goods or treasures, deal with merchants and traders, find black-market goods and services, and know laws regarding smuggling and contraband.
- **Work**: This skill is a catch-all for any profession that might not otherwise merit its own skill, such as a painter, lawyer, farmer, or herdsman.
  The precise skill it represents will vary with the PC’s background.

## Backgrounds

Every character has a Background, a past reflecting their career before they took up adventuring.
A background may be chosen from the list below or a new one made up with GM permission.

### Background Skills

When a Background is chosen, a PC immediately gets its free skill at level-0.
At that point, the player decides whether to gain further skills randomly or to pick specific choices.
If they choose randomly, they may make three rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables of their background in any way they wish, including taking all three from just one table.
If they pick specific choices they can pick any two skills from the Learning table, including picking the same one twice to raise it to level-1.
They may not pick the “Any Skill” option, if it exists.
A skill pick of “Any Combat” means the player can pick Shoot, Stab, or Punch.
A skill roll of “Any Skill” means they can pick any skill from the list above.
Some campaigns may involve special magical or psychic skills; these cannot be chose with the Any Skill pick.
If an attribute bonus is rolled, such as "+2 Physical", the player may apply it to any physical attribute or split the bonus between two physical attributes.
The same principle applies to Mental attribute increases.
"Any Stat" increases may be applied to either physical or mental attributes.
No attribute can be raised above 18.

### New Backgrounds

To create a new background, the player describes it to the GM and picks an existing background table that best fits the concept.
Assuming the GM approves it, they may then roll or pick as usual.
If no existing background table fits, they may make a new one with the GM’s permission.

### Example Backgrounds

The two following backgrounds are examples of those possible for a player, with others to be created as the designer thinks appropriate for their setting.
The free granted skill is listed after each background’s name.

## Classes

PCs are uncommon in that each of them has a class.
A class represents the particular skills, abilities, or talents that make the PC a viable adventurer.
NPCs do not normally have classes, though they may have special abilities or powers of their own.

### The Three Base Classes

The three base classes are Expert, Mage, and Warrior.
Each of these base classes has its own hit die, attack progression, and Focus advancement.
PCs use the tables for the class they choose.

### Full and Partial Classes

There are two kinds of classes: Full classes and Partial classes.
A PC may choose to pick a single Full class, committing completely to that class’ profession, or they may choose to become an Adventurer and pick two Partial classes instead, mixing their abilities.
The Warrior, Expert, High Mage, Necromancer, Invoker, and Elementalist classes may be taken either as a Full class or as a Partial class.
In the former case, the PC gains the full range of powers granted to the profession.
If taken as a Partial class, a more restricted range of abilities are granted.
The Healer, Vowed, Bard, Thought Noble, Accursed, Wise, Mageslayer, Skinshifter, Duelist, Beastmaster, and Blood Priest can only be taken as Partial classes.
These classes are limited in scope, and must be paired with another Partial class.

### The Adventurer Class

The Adventurer is a special class that allows the PC to take two Partial classes and mix them together.
These may be Partial-only classes, such as a Healer/Vowed, or they may be Partial versions of Warrior, Expert, or Mage classes, such as a Partial Expert/Thought Noble.
A dual-specialization spellcaster is also possible by mixing a Partial High Mage/Partial Elementalist together, for example.

### Classes and Effort

Some classes have special abilities that are fueled with magical power, inner focus, or some other reserve of energy.
This capacity is measured in points of Effort, a resource the PC can commit to activate their abilities.
Every class that uses Effort has its own unique pool: High Mage Effort, Vowed Effort, Healer Effort, and so forth.
Adventurers with two Partial classes that use Effort have two separately-tracked pools, one for each class.
Points of Effort from one class cannot be used to fuel powers from another.
The maximum Effort of a Full class is equal to 1 plus a relevant skill level and ability modifier given by the class.
A Partial class uses the same formula, but with 1 fewer point of Effort, to a minimum of 1.

### Committing Effort

Most class powers require that Effort be Committed.
Committing Effort is done as part of activating a power, and ties up the Effort for a varying amount of time depending on the ability used.
Some powers Commit Effort for the duration.
This means the Effort remains Committed as long as the power is active.
The PC can reclaim the Committed Effort at any time as an Instant action, deactivating the power.
Some powers Commit Effort for the scene.
The Effort remains Committed until the end of the scene, after which it returns to the PC.
It cannot be reclaimed earlier, even if the ability it fuels is only good for a single attack or action.
A scene usually amounts to a single fight, event, or dungeon turn, almost never lasting more than fifteen minutes.
Further specifics are provided in the time section of the game rules.
Some powers Commit Effort for the day.
Once Committed, this Effort can be recovered only after a comfortable night’s rest.
If the PC is hungry, cold, sick, or sleeping without the benefits of a bedroll or other basic comforts, this Effort cannot be recovered.
Activating a power only ever requires Committing a single point of Effort, unless the power itself says otherwise.
