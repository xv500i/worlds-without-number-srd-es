Character Creation
Attributes
A character has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal human level.
Three of these attributes are physical.
Strength, reflecting physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, and brute force.
Dexterity, reflecting speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, and combat initiative.
Constitution, reflecting hardiness, enduring injury, and tolerating large amounts of magical healing.
Three are mental attributes.
Intelligence, reflecting memory, reasoning, technical skills, and general education.
Wisdom, reflecting noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, and intuition.
Charisma, reflecting commanding, charming, attracting attention, and being taken seriously.
NPCs do not normally have attributes. If necessary, the GM can choose them as appropriate, but usually they are assumed to have average scores if it’s ever relevant.
Generating Attributes
To generate their six attributes, the player rolls 3d6 in order, once for each attribute. At any point before section 1.5.0 in character creation the player may substitute a score of 14 for one rolled score.
Optionally, a player may choose to assign their stats from the following array of numbers: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7, divided up as desired among the attributes. If an array is used a score may not be substituted with a 14 later.
Attribute Modifiers
Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.
An attribute score of 3 has a modifier of -2. A score of 4-7 has a modifier of -1. A score of 8-13 has a modifier of +0. A score of 14-17 has a modifier of +1. A score of 18 has a modifier of +2.
Some Foci and abilities may add bonuses or penalties to an attribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2 unless explicitly indicated. Some injuries or character advancements may alter an attribute score; this new score may change the attribute’s modifier.
Skills
A character’s skills are the PC’s learned abilities. A newly-created character starts with a few relevant skills and may acquire more as they advance in level. NPCs do not have individual skills, instead relying on their combat stat line’s skill bonus when relevant. See section 2.3.0 for the rules for making skill checks.
Skill Levels
Skills are rated on a scale between level-0 and level-4. A character must reach a certain minimum experience level to develop a skill to level-2 or beyond.

| Nivel | Descripción |
| ----- | ----------- |
| a     | b           |

Nivel
Descripción
Nivel-0
Basic competence in the skill, such as an ordinary practitioner would have
Nivel-1
An experienced professional in the skill, clearly better than most
Nivel-2
Veteran expert, one respected even by those with considerable experience
Nivel-3
Master of the skill, likely one of the best in the city
Nivel-4
Superlative expertise, one of the best in the world
Gaining Skills in Character Creation
Characters gain skills from their Backgrounds as described in the section below and from a single free pick in section 1.7.4. Some Foci also grant particular skills. The first time a skill is picked or given, a character obtains it at level-0. The second time it is picked or given, the skill becomes level-1. The third and further times a skill is picked or given during character creation, the player instead picks any other skill that is not already level-1. No character can begin play with skills above level-1.
The Skill List
The following skills are standard to most fantasy campaigns. Gms may add or subtract from this list for specialized settings. Some skills may overlap at points in their application; the character may use either skill at their discretion.
Administer: Keep an organization running smoothly, scribe things well, plan out logistics, identify incompetent or treacherous workers, analyze records or archives, or otherwise do things that an executive or middle-manager would need to do.
Connect: Find or know people who are useful to your purposes, make friendships or social acquaintances, know who to talk to get favors or services, and call on the help or resources of organizations you belong to. Connect covers your PC’s ability to find the people you need, though convincing them to help may require more than this.
Convince: Persuade a listener that something you are saying is true. Naturally, the more implausible the claim or more emotionally repugnant it is to them, the more difficult it is to persuade them. Furthermore, how they act on their newfound conviction is up to them and their motivations, and may not be perfectly predictable.
Craft: Craft or repair goods and technology appropriate to the PC’s
background and society. The Craft skill can be used for a wide range
of artisan pursuits, though a GM is within their rights to keep the PC
from building complex things that are too far away from their past
background and experience.
Exert: Run, swim, climb, jump, labor for long periods, throw things,
or otherwise exert your physical strength, stamina, and coordination.
Even a PC with poor physical attributes might have a good Exert skill
reflecting athletic training and expertise in making the most of their
available talents.
Heal: Treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons, diagnose
psychological health issues, and otherwise tend to the wounds of
body and mind. The Heal skill cannot cure lost hit points directly, but
it’s a vital skill in stabilizing Mortally Wounded allies or ensuring
